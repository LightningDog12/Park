<h1>Birth of a National Park</h1>
<p>
The prime achievement was helping to save Yellowstone from private development. The Yosemite Act of 1864, reserved Yosemite Valley from settlement and entrusted it to the care of the state of California. To permanently close any settlements to an expanse of the public domain the size of Yellowstone would defer from the established policy of transferring public lands to private ownership. But the wonders of Yellowstone had captured the imagination of Congress. Thanks to their reports, the United States Congress established Yellowstone National Park. When President Ulysses S. Grant signed the Yellowstone National Park Protection Act into law on March 1, 1872, he created the National park service and the world’s first national park was born.</p>

<p>The Yellowstone National Park Protection Act was straightforward in establishing Yellowstone as a park not to be developed or sold, but to serve as a national treasure and resource: “[Yellowstone] is hereby reserved and withdrawn from settlement, occupancy, or sale under the laws of the United States, and dedicated and set apart as a public park or pleasuring-ground for the benefit and enjoyment of the people…. It would be exclusively controlled by The Secretary of the Interior.
